Objective
To understand what makes a password strong and test it against password strength tools. This involves creating and evaluating multiple passwords with varying complexity, length, and character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols).


Tools Used

Online Password Strength Checker: An online tool like passwordmeter.com was used to evaluate password strength.

Summary of Evaluation
A report was created to document the password strength evaluation. The report includes:

Results from testing several passwords with different characteristics.

Scores and feedback received from the password strength checker.

A summary of best practices for creating strong passwords based on the evaluation.

Key Concepts Explored
During this task, I gained an understanding of several key concepts in password security, including:


Password Strength: The measure of how difficult a password is to crack.


Brute-Force Attack: A method where a program systematically tries every possible password combination until the correct one is found.


Dictionary Attack: An attack that uses a list of common words and phrases to try and guess a password.


Authentication: The process of verifying a user's identity.


Best Practices: Guidelines for creating secure passwords that are difficult to compromise.

Outcome# -Password-Strength-Evaluation
 Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength". The main objective is for interns to understand what constitutes a strong password and to test its strength using available online tools. The deliverables for this task include a report that presents the results of the password strength evaluation and an explanation of the findings.
